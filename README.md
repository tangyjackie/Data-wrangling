# Data-wrangling
This repo serves as storage for my data wrangling projects.

The data wrangling repo contains projects related to wrangling and manipulating large datasets.
The purpose of this repo is to showcase projects that are specific to the production of new data sets, to data retrieved from new queries, and to the conversion of files to new file formats.
There is some basic analysis on the results of the creation of these new data sets and files.

Languages used in this repo are mainly MongoDB and Python.
