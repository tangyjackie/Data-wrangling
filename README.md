# Data-wrangling
This repo serves as storage for my data wrangling projects.


README FILE: DAND OSM project

There are seven files in this project.

1) Open_street_map.py
The file above contains the code used to generate the JSON file.

2) db_trial1.py
This file above contains the MongoDB code/queries used to write the investigative analysis and to
inform of potential benefits/ anticipated problems with improving the cleaning process.
It also contains code used to inform how I later cleaned the Toronto OSM data.

3) Link_to_map_OSM.txt:
This file above contains the link from which an OSM file was downloaded for Toronto.
It also has a link to the definition of the regions that comprise the Greater Toronto Area.

4) DAND_OSM_Sources.txt:
This file above contains the sources that I consulted for this project.

5) Toronto_OSM_submission.pdf
This file above contains my written answers for the summary statistics, how I cleaned and audited the file,
an investigative analysis on several fields, and suggestions for improvement in the cleaning of the dataset 
along with any anticipated problems that could arise.

6)interpreter
This contains the exact sample file I used to test my shape_element function for cleaning and auditing the data.

7)interpreter_et.json
This contains the JSON output file (later renamed to interpreter_et.json) from running the shape_element and process_map
function on the interpreter file above.
